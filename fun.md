I'm a [firstgen](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+generation+college+student&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS987US988&oq=first+generation+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i433i512l2j0i512j0i433i512j0i512j0i433i512.3044j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) from rural North Carolina. Having said that, my amazing mom (who immigrated to the US in the 90s) started going to school in the early 2000s and completed her Bachelor's while I was in my doctoral program. She now works as an oncology nurse. Needless to say, she has been a powerful and inspiring influence in my life.

In 2021, I was funded as an [ODS Research Scholar](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/Scholars.aspx) for my project examining fatty acids and infant adiposity and atopic outcomes. In 2023, I was awarded a K99/R00 award to investigate gestational phthalate and phthalate alternative exposures associated with early life cardiometabolic development. I am happy to chat about these or any of my other training experiences.

I am passionate about mentoring & teaching. I would not be here today without guidance of an amazing and diverse group of teachers and mentors, and I strive to pass that on to the next generation of scientists.

In my spare time, I run long-distance and hang out with my awesome partner and our two dogs. Some maybe-fun facts: I tried to renovate an old ambulance into a camper van (key word: tried), I was a part of unicycle club in school, and I've gone white water rafting on the Nile River.
