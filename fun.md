I'm a [firstgen](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+generation+college+student&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS987US988&oq=first+generation+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i433i512l2j0i512j0i433i512j0i512j0i433i512.3044j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) from rural North Carolina. Having said that, my amazing mom (who immigrated to the US in the 90s) started going to school in the early 2000s and completed her Bachelor's while I was in my doctoral program. She now works as an oncology nurse. Needless to say, she has been a powerful and inspiring influence in my life.

I am passionate about my research and career. It may seem naive, but I truly believe that my research can help improve health across the lifecourse and in future generations. I am dedicated to enhancing the health of all persons but especially more vulnerable populations and those overlooked in research studies (e.g., pregnant persons, infants, children, rural populations). I would not be here today without the guidance of an amazing and diverse group of teachers and mentors, and I strive to pass that on to the next generation of scientists. Teaching and mentoring students and trainees is one of my favorite parts of my job.

In my spare time, I run long-distance, garden, and hang out with my awesome partner and our two dogs. Some fun facts: I renovated an old ambulance into a camper van, I can ride a unicycle, and I've rafted on the Nile River.
