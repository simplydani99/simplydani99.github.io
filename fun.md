I'm a [firstgen](https://www.google.com/search?q=first+generation+college+student&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS987US988&oq=first+generation+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i433i512l2j0i512j0i433i512j0i512j0i433i512.3044j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) from rural North Carolina. Having said that, my amazing mom (who immigrated to the US in the 90s) started going to school in the early 2000s and completed her Bachelor's while I was in my doctoral program. She now works as an oncology nurse. Needless to say, she has been a powerful and inspiring influence in my life.

In my spare time, I run long-distance, garden, and hang out with my awesome partner and our two dogs. Some fun facts: I renovated an old ambulance into a camper van, I can ride a unicycle, and I've rafted on the Nile River.
