Danielle is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Perinatal and Early Life Epidemiology Lab](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/pi/perinatal/staff/index.cfm) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Danielle received her PhD in Epidemiology from the [Department of Public Health Sciences](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/phs/about) at the Medical University of South Carolina in 2019. During that time, she received specialized training in [clinical and translational research](https://research.musc.edu/resources/sctr/funding-opportunities/training-program). She was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Epidemiology Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/dir/dph/officebranch/eb) until 2021. She previously received a [BS in Health Sciences from Furman University](https://www.furman.edu/academics/health-sciences/program-overview/health-sciences-bs/) and worked as a [research assistant for LiveWell Greenville](https://livewellgreenville.org/).

In 2021, Danielle was funded as an [ODS Research Scholar](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/Scholars.aspx) for a project examining fatty acids and infant adiposity and atopic outcomes. In 2023, Danielle was awarded a [K99/R00](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) to investigate [gestational phthalate and phthalate alternative exposures associated with early life cardiometabolic development](https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2023/7/beyond-the-bench/pathway-to-independence-awards).

Danielle aims to conduct rigorous and impactful research on the causes and consequences of respiratory and cardiometabolic disorders. She is particularly interested in early life as a period of increased susceptibility to environmental exposures influencing cardiometabolic health across the lifecourse.

Specific areas of research include:
- Chemical environmental exposures
   * Persistent and nonpersistent chemical exposures found in everyday personal care and consumer products
   * Exposure assessment and bias
- Nutrition and physical activity
   * Fatty acids such as omega-3s found in seafood, oils, and nuts
   * Co-occurence and interactions with the environmental chemical exposures
   * Exposure assessment and bias
- Non-chemical environmental exposures
   * Built environment, air pollution, and climate change
   * Geospatial methods
- Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
- Cardiometabolic health and asthma 
   * Etiology and prognosis
   * Biomarkers and other indicators of disease
- Fetal and pediatric growth and development
   * Growth and longitudinal modeling
   * Ultrasound & echocardiography
   * Assessment and analysis of body composition and anatomical structures

To ensure a thorough and thoughtful implementation, underlying this research is training in and a focus on:
- Environmental justice and health disparities
- Community-based participatory research
- Epidemiologic methods
   * Mixtures modeling
   * Causal inference
   * Bias
