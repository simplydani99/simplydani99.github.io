Danielle is a postdoctoral fellow in the [Perinatal and Early Life Epidemiology Lab](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/pi/perinatal/staff/index.cfm) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Danielle received her PhD in Epidemiology from the [Department of Public Health Sciences](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/phs/about) at the Medical University of South Carolina in 2019. During that time, she received specialized training in [clinical and translational research](https://research.musc.edu/resources/sctr/funding-opportunities/training-program). She was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Epidemiology Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/dir/dph/officebranch/eb) until 2021. She previously received a [BS in Health Sciences from Furman University](https://www.furman.edu/academics/health-sciences/program-overview/health-sciences-bs/) and worked as a [research assistant for LiveWell Greenville](https://livewellgreenville.org/).

Danielle's research broadly focuses on the causes and consequences of respiratory and cardiometabolic disorders. She is particularly interested in pregnancy as a period of increased susceptibility to environmental chemical exposures influencing growth and cardiometabolic outcomes across the lifecourse. Specific areas of interest include:
- Chemical environmental exposures
   * Persistent and nonpersistent chemical exposures found in everday personal care and consumer products
   * Exposure assessment methods and bias
- Nutrition and physical activity
   * Fatty acids such as omega-3s found in seafood, oils, and nuts
   * Co-occurence and interactions with the environmental chemical exposures
   * Exposure assessment methods and bias
- Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
- Cardiometabolic health and asthma in children and gestational parents
   * Etiology and prognosis
   * Biomarkers and other indicators of these outcomes in infancy
- Fetal and pediatric growth and development
   * Growth and longitudinal modeling
   * Identifying heterogeneity in growth
   * Assessment and analysis of body composition and other more precise body measures (e.g., fat mass, liver size)
- Environmental justice and health disparities
- Epidemiologic methods
   * Mixtures modeling
   * Causal inference
   * Bias
